<h4> Our project aims to address the inefficiencies and challenges faced by government
hospitals in managing clinical services. The Hospital Clinical Services Management
System (HCSMS) will revolutionize the way healthcare services are delivered by
introducing innovative features to streamline patient registration, appointment
scheduling and request, chatbot and medical record management. This HCSMS is developed for the ENT clinic at Kolonna Base Hospital.</h4>
